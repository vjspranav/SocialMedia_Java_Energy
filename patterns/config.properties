# Get also power and energy for methods starting with this package.class.method name
# Example: filter-method-names=Package to filter energy for all methods whose full name start with Package
# Note that JoularJX will always generate energy for all non-filtered method in a separate file
# So you can safely keep this empty if you don't want to filter methods
# You can add multiple identifiers names separated by a comma, ordered by priority
# JoularJX will monitor and filter methods for all these packages
# Example: filter-method-names=Package,Package2,Package3
filter-method-names=Package

# Write runtime methods power consumption in a CSV file
# Setting this option to false won't generate any runtime files

# Setting it to false will write files for every monitoring cycle (1 sec per cycle)

# Set to OFF to disable it
# Allowed values: OFF, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE

# Setting this option to true will generate one CSV file per monitored method
# Each CSV file will contain the power consumption on every monitored timestamp

# Overwrite runtime call trees power data file. If set to true, only one runtime file will be generated, and it will be overwritten for each monitoring cycle.
# Setting it to false will generate new files for every monitoring cycle (1 sec per cycle). The said files ill include timestamps in their name.
